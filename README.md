# GPUImage-Gestures
CoreML object/gesture recognition with GPUImage

Initial inspiration from reading https://github.com/hanleyweng/Gesture-Recognition-101-CoreML-ARKit but with an existing app using GPUImage

Same CoreML model, same functionality, but with the forward-facing camera and without ARKit, SceneKit.
